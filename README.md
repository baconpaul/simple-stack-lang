This is another repo you are better off ignoring for now.

On slack I had the idea of making a VCV Rack module which ran a brainf*ck interpreter to make CV output. That's a
strange idea of course, and BF is too tiny a language to be even remotely usable, but perhaps there is a slightly
bigger language which could be helpful.

Or maybe not.

But it was fun to implement a BF interpreter at least.
